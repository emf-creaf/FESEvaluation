	abstract = {The aim of this study was to predict the effect of forest management intensity on mushroom productivity at the landscape level by means of a model-based scenario analysis. The study area was Catalonia region, north-eastern Iberian Peninsula. Mushroom yield models were developed for the most common pinedominated forest ecosystems. The models accounted for the effect of site and stand structure on mushroom occurrence and yield. The mushroom yield models and individual-tree growth models were used in continuous cover forestry simulation and optimization to assess the impact of alternative regional forest management intensity scenarios on landscape-level mushroom productivity. The baseline scenario was deﬁned as the estimated current forest harvesting intensity in Catalonia (i.e., 25\% of annual forest growth). The time frame was 30 yr. The current average productivity of valuable mushrooms is 14 kg haÀ1 yrÀ1 (4600 tonnes yrÀ1). Under the current forest management intensity, a loss of 220 tonnes yrÀ1 (5\%) in mushroom production at the regional level can be expected. In the absence of forest management, the loss in productivity can attain almost 500 tonnes yrÀ1 (11\%). With forest harvesting intensity similar to the average in Europe, an increase of 100 tonnes yrÀ1 (2\%) in mushroom production could be expected. If forest harvesting was equal to 100\% of annual forest growth, an increase of 262 tonnes yrÀ1 (6\%) could be expected. Mushroom productivity increases with increasing forest management intensity. Low forest management intensities may result in a progressive reduction in mushroom yield. Intermediate management intensities would maintain the current mushroom productivity. Sustained yield harvesting policy would contribute to increasing mushroom productivity in continuous cover forestry.},

Two known models of rainfall erosivity (named after the first author of the original paper, Torri and Yang) were also assessed and compared with the MedREM. Yang and Torri models are both based on the annual precipitation models. MedREM also takes annual maximum daily precipitation data into account, and incorporates a longitude-dependent coefficient. The test area was a large region centered on the Mediterranean basin, in which 66 weather stations were available - 43 Italian and 23 out-of-Italy sites (12 countries, about 30-50° latitude North, and 10-50° longitude East) - with multi-year data of (R)USLE annual erosivity. The three models were calibrated against (R)USLE rainfall erosivity data from 55 stations and evaluated over a validation dataset from 11 Italian stations. On the validation dataset, the MedREM estimates generally compared well with the (R)USLE data according to Nush-Sutcliffe coefficient (0.87 against 0.76 and 0.73 with Torri and Yang model, respectively). Implications for erosivity modelling were discussed in the context of climatic features concluding that accurate estimations of site-specific annual erosivity for the Mediterranean region require process-based model with spatially-explicit parameterization. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Abstract The concept of ecosystem services has received increased attention in recent years, and is seen as a useful construct for the development of policy relevant indicators and communication for science, policy and practice. Soil erosion is one of the main environmental problems for European Mediterranean agro-forestry systems, making soil erosion prevention a key ecosystem service to monitor and assess. Here, we present a spatially and temporally explicit assessment of the provision of soil erosion prevention by vegetation in Mediterranean Europe between 2001 and 2013, including maps of vulnerable areas. We follow a recently described conceptual framework for the mapping and assessment of regulating ecosystem services to calculate eight process-based indicators, and an ecosystem service provision profile. Results show a relative increase in the effectiveness of provision of soil erosion prevention in Mediterranean Europe between 2001 and 2013. This increase is particularly noticeable between 2009 and 2013, but it does not represent a general trend across the whole Mediterranean region. Two regional examples describe contrasting trends and illustrate the need for regional assessments and policy targets. Our results demonstrate the strength of having a coherent and complementary set of indicators for regulating services to inform policy and land management decisions.},

	abstract = {Climate change projections over the Mediterranean basin point toward an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events that will directly impact ecosystems resilience. In this study, we evaluated future trends of soil loss in forestland in Catalonia (NE Spain) due to fires and vegetation dynamics, considering the potential future impacts of co-occurring extreme fire and rainfall events, and assessing how fire suppression can contribute to soil erosion mitigation. The process-based MEDFIRE model was used to simulate changes in forestland due to climate and fires between 2011 and 2050 under six different future scenarios that resulted from the combination of two climatic scenarios and three fire management policies. Annual projections on landscape changes were used to estimate soil loss using the Universal Soil Loss Equation. Projected annual soil losses for forested land in Catalonia ranged between 15 and 16 tons/ha, with scenarios simulating current levels of fire suppression projecting around −5\% soil loss than those assuming more relaxed suppression strategies. On average, fires explained 12–16\% of annual soil loss in the region, but in fire-severe years, they explained up to 90\% of the total annual soil loss. Projected mean total soil loss in years where extreme rainfall and fire meet was 150\% higher than in years where both events were not contemporary. The estimated annual probability that the two extreme impacts will co-occur in the future ranged between 0.09 and 0.11 between scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of landscape and fire management in minimizing soil loss and its potential impacts for ecosystems.},

Different tree biomass components were considered: stem with bark, branches of different sizes, above and belowground biomass. For each species, a system of equations was fitted using seemingly unrelated regression, fulfilling the additivity property between biomass components. Diameter and total height were explored as independent variables. All models included tree diameter whereas for the majority of species, total height was only considered in the stem biomass models and in some of the branch models. The comparison of the new biomass models with previous models fitted separately for each tree component indicated an improvement in the accuracy of the models. A mean reduction of 20\% in the root mean square error and a mean increase in the model efficiency of 7\% in comparison with recently published models. So, the fitted models allow estimating more accurately the biomass stock in hardwood species from the Spanish National Forest Inventory data.},

	abstract = {The greatest obstacle to soil erosion modelling at larger spatial scales is the lack of data on soil characteristics. One key parameter for modelling soil erosion is the soil erodibility, expressed as the K-factor in the widely used soil erosion model, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its revised version (RUSLE). The K-factor, which expresses the susceptibility of a soil to erode, is related to soil properties such as organic matter content, soil texture, soil structure and permeability. With the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) soil survey in 2009 a pan-European soil dataset is available for the first time, consisting of around 20,000 points across 25 Member States of the European Union. The aim of this study is the generation of a harmonised high-resolution soil erodibility map (with a grid cell size of 500m) for the 25 EU Member States. Soil erodibility was calculated for the LUCAS survey points using the nomograph of Wischmeier and Smith (1978). A Cubist regression model was applied to correlate spatial data such as latitude, longitude, remotely sensed and terrain features in order to develop a high-resolution soil erodibility map. The mean K-factor for Europe was estimated at 0.032thahha−1MJ−1mm−1 with a standard deviation of 0.009thahha−1MJ−1mm−1. The yielded soil erodibility dataset compared well with the published local and regional soil erodibility data. However, the incorporation of the protective effect of surface stone cover, which is usually not considered for the soil erodibility calculations, resulted in an average 15\% decrease of the K-factor. The exclusion of this effect in K-factor calculations is likely to result in an overestimation of soil erosion, particularly for the Mediterranean countries, where highest percentages of surface stone cover were observed.},

The European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) developed a new pan-European high-resolution soil erosion assessment to achieve a better understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of soil erosion in Europe. The LS-calculation was performed using the original equation proposed by Desmet and Govers (1996) and implemented using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA), which incorporates a multiple flow algorithm and contributes to a precise estimation of flow accumulation. The LS-factor dataset was calculated using a high-resolution (25 m) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the whole European Union, resulting in an improved delineation of areas at risk of soil erosion as compared to lower-resolution datasets. This combined approach of using GIS software tools with high-resolution DEMs has been successfully applied in regional assessments in the past, and is now being applied for first time at the European scale.},
